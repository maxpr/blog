title: Vegan Fried Chicken (Deep Fried Maitake Mushroom)

---



This might sound weird, but this is the closest dish in term of taste to Fried Chicken that I have ever eaten. In any case you should try it, it is slightly dryer but delicious !

**What you need (2pax):**

- 150 g of Maitake mushrooms 
- 1 Tablespoon salt & pepper (2 if you like the slightly salty taste)
- 1 Tablespoon of Paprika
- 1 Tablespoon of Garlic Powder
- 80g of Panko
- 2 eggs
- 80g of flour
- Greens/Veggies for side (here I chose tomatoes and Edamame + ham)
- Enough (canola, peanut, ...) oil in a saucepan to deep fry or a fryer 



**Preparation time**: 20 minutes

**Cooking time**: 5 minutes



First get the mushroom and separate them by hand so that each pieces is small enough to be eaten in one or two bites.

Prepare 3 bowls:

- one with the flour
- one with the eggs mixed
- one with the panko + garlic powder + paprika + salt and pepper mixed well with a fork, but don't break the panko !

First dip the mushroom in the flour, tap it lightly to remove the excess flour, dip in egg remove and wait for the excess of egg to fall back in the bowl.

Finally dip in the panko mix. Try to keep one your hand to handle the flour and panko, and the other one will handle the egg wash.

Prepare your oil at around 190 degree C (medium heat on a stove) and wait for it to be hot. It should not be smoking, but bubbly when you put a piece of panko it it.

Place it in the hot oil, and cook until golden, just before it get browns, get them out. It should take maximum 1min30 to 2 minutes by piece.
