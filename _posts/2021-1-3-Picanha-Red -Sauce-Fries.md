You can now cut the potatoes (I like to keep the skin but feel free to peel it) into small sticks of 3-4 cm in length and 1 in thickness. Then put them in a bowl of water for 15 minutes.

After the time is passed, remove the potatoes from the bowl and dry them with paper towel. Chose to deep-fry or air-fry the fries. In case of air fries, put at 180 for 18 minutes. For deep fries, oil a 180 and cook first for 5 minutes and then again for 12 more minutes.

While the fries are cooking, you can pan fry the meat. 1 min 30 second on each side with 20 grams of butter at medium high heat.

When panning the second side, after 1 minutes (30 seconds before the end) add the rest of the butter as well as the rosemary and cook on fire until the butter is melted.

Then take the pan out of the fire and bask the meat with the melted butter for 1 to 2 minutes.

Put the meat on a board and let it rest for 10 minutes under an aluminum foil.



Take your 20 cl of wine, and pour it in the pan and bring the liquid to a boil. Add 3 tablespoon of flour and when the consistency is like syrup, keep it out of the fire.
