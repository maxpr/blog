![Ingredients]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/cheeseburger/1.jpg)

We start with the onion, the goal is to make caramelised onions.

![Onions]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/cheeseburger/2.jpg)

To do so, take your onions, peal them and cut them in half while keeping the root, it helps for cutting.
![Onions2]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/cheeseburger/3.jpg)

Slice and put them in a pan with hot oil and butter on medium high heat.
![Onions3]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/cheeseburger/4.jpg)
![Onions4]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/cheeseburger/5.jpg)

Keep watching and stirring them from time to timeto avoid burning.

Meanwhile, peal the potatoes and slice them into fries size.

![Fries]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/cheeseburger/7.jpg)
Put them into a bowl of water, for 15 minutes to remove the starch. At this point check the onions again.

Now we prepare the meat. Put the meat out and form 2 balls.

Cut some parsley and garlic, and stuff it in the middle of the meat ball.

Then mix again to spread the garlic and the parsley inside the meat. Add salt and pepper on one side.

Go back to the onion and salt them, it should be around 10 minutes since you started stirring them. If it becomes too dry, add a bit of water. Lower the heat to medium low.

Go back to prepare the salad and mushroom. Just get a few leaves out and cut the mushroom in 4.

Let's now get to the sauce. This is a hamburger sauce and you will need 2 table spoon of ketchup, 2 of mayonnaise, a tea spoon of mustard and pickles.
![sauces]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/cheeseburger/18.jpg)

Chop the pickles and add the sauce one by one, mix and you are ready.

![sauces5]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/cheeseburger/23.jpg)

Go back to the onion one last time, they should look like this. Cut the fire and leave them a bit more before transferring them to a bowl.
![caramelisedOnions]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/potatosalad/24.jpg)

Remove the fries from the water and put them in a strainer.
![strainer]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/cheeseburger/25.jpg)

Prepare a sauce pan and add some oil to fry. I personally used peanut oil.

![fry]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/cheeseburger/26.jpg)
![fry2]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/cheeseburger/27.jpg)

Dry the fries with paper towel.
![friesDried]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/cheeseburger/28.jpg)

Reserve the onion in a bowl for later usage.
![bowlonions]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/cheeseburger/29.jpg)


Prepare the bun by cutting them both in half.
![sauces5]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/cheeseburger/23.jpg)

Meanwhile, pan the bacon on high heat to make it cryspy, and cut some slice or small pieces or cheese.
![bacon]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/cheeseburger/31.jpg)
![cheese]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/cheeseburger/32.jpg)

Remove the bacon when cooked, and put the mushroom in the bacon oil. Pan for 1 minutes to keep the mushroom nice and crunchy.
(you can cook more if you don't like them a bit raw)

![mushroomoil]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/cheeseburger/34.jpg)
![mushroomdone]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/cheeseburger/35.jpg)

Toast the bottom side of the bun in the rest of the oil for 1 minute and put the fries in the hot oil.

![bunsbottom]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/cheeseburger/36.jpg)
![friesinoil]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/cheeseburger/37.jpg)

Put the bun in the plate, add the hamburger sauce on the bottom and put the salad on top of it.
![bunpresent]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/cheeseburger/38.jpg)
![bunwithsauce]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/cheeseburger/39.jpg)
![bunwithsauceandsalad]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/cheeseburger/40.jpg)

Clean your pan, and toast the upper bun for 30 seconds each just to get warm.

![pancleaned]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/cheeseburger/41.jpg)
![bunstop]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/cheeseburger/42.jpg)

Put back your pan on medium high heat and add a piece butter.
Put the steak with the salty side first on the pan. Pan for 1 to 2 minutes. Then flip them.
![steak1]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/cheeseburger/43.jpg)
![steak2]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/cheeseburger/44.jpg)
![steak3]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/cheeseburger/45.jpg)

Put the cheese on top and cover with a lid, let cook for another 1 to 2 minutes.

![steakcheese]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/cheeseburger/46.jpg)
![steaklid]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/cheeseburger/47.jpg)

In the mean time, the fries should be ready and look like this.
![friesdone]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/cheeseburger/48.jpg)

Assemble all the ingredients left to put together.

![ingredientleft]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/cheeseburger/49.jpg)

And put the steak on top of it, caramelised onion on the top bun, and bacon/mushroom on the top of the steak.
