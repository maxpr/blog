**What you need (2pax):**

- 6 asparagus
- 2 chicken breasts
- 1/3 of a Pesto bottle
- Parmesan Cheese

First get all your ingredients out.

Then, cut the chicken into small strips to be able to coat them in pesto and parmesan and have a faster cooking. Add pepper and salt if needed (the pesto is already a bit salty and so is the parmesan)

Cut the bottom part of the asparagus to discard, and then cut them into 3 parts.

Get a baking mold, and spread a bit of pesto on the bottom. Then add your pieces of chicken and mix to coat everything. This will help having a "oiled" baking mold too.

Then place everything at the center, well separated and not superposed. Add the pieces of asparagus around to form a square with several layers on top of each other.

Finally, add some parmesan cheese, before putting everything in the oven for 25 minutes at 180 degrees Celsius.
