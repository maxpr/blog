Season the fish and place the small cube (keep the slices) of onion around it. I do like thyme so I di put a lot, but feel free to try all the combination of spices you want.

Add black garlic and the olive oil on top of the fish. Then cover with the potatoes and onions. Top it with your sauce if you have one, else leave it as is.

Now fold the bottom and up edges over the fish and start folding the right and left edge on top of it to enclose everything. Try to make it sealed, as a lot of liquid is gonna render from this,

As a precaution, I add a layer of aluminum to fully wrap the original packaging.

Then put in the oven for 1 hour at 200 degrees C.

Unroll while keeping up to make sure the liquid does not spill,
