First prepare all the ingredients

Prepare in a bowl:

- an egg yolk
- a bit of salt
- The mustard

You will make mayonnaise.

Start to whisk together, and add a slight bit of oil and mix. Do this until the texture is homogeneous and start to form a thicker texture. If you don't it will separate and you will have to start over. Then add more oil until desire texture is met.

Keep in fridge and go to the rest.

Cut your avocado in half (horizontally), remove the core. Keep the outside we will use as container to to put back the salad ! Cut the shallot in small pieces too.

Then mix them all together, with the tuna and start mashing it. Keep some granularity for nice salad texture.

 Now add the salt and pepper and Mayonnaise. Put back the salad back in the outside layer and put in the fridge, with the lemon next to it.

Now for the omelette.

Cut you bacon in bits.

Start cooking your bacon in medium heat to make it nice and crispy and render oil and salt.



In the mean time, in a bowl, mix the 3 eggs for 3 to 5 minutes to make it more airy.

As I don't like runny eggs, I let it cook for a while but feel free to cook less if you prefer.
