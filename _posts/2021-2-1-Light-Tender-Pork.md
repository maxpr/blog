Cut the pork in half to be thinner. Then slice the meat so that the molecules from onion can penetrate the meat.

Then cut the onions, garlic and chives and cover every side of the meat. Put it in a plate and in the fridge for at least 1 hour.

Cut the daikon in slices to steam it. I use water with soy sauce and mirin for the steaming.

Get the meat out of the fridge, remove the oinions and prepare to cook the meat.
Then cook the meat in medium high heat for 3 minutes on each side. Reserve the meat, and cook the daikon and the onions
