title: Mushroom Stuffed Mini Peppers

---

This recipe was a test and ended up being a disappointment for 2 main reasons:

- The type of mushroom used (button Japanese mushroom). It was too flavorful and watery
- The seasoning lacked and too much garlic was added. I will modify this in the recipe

**What you need (2pax):**

- 150 g of mushrooms (White mushroom preferred)
- salt & pepper
- 1 tablespoon of tomato paste
- 2 teaspoon of garlic powder (or half a garlic finely sliced)
- 4 small peppers or 2 big peppers
- 1 tablespoon of olive oil
- 2 tablespoon of parmesan cheese
- Pasta or Rice as a side



**Preparation time**: 15 minutes

**Cooking time**: 15 minutes



First get the pepper and cut the top. Remove the inside.

Minced your mushroom, add 3 pinches of salt, pepper to taste, the tablespoon of tomato paste, the olive oil and the 2 tablespoon of parmesan cheese.

Either mix by hand or with a robot. Had the minced garlic in the end, if you mix it the taste will be too strong.

At this point, you should cook the paste to dry the mushroom mix (mistake that I made because I did not do it). Either pan it for 3 minutes or spread on parchment paper and oven at 200 degrees C for 3 minutes.



Then stuff the peppers, add a bit of parmesan or Emmental on top of it

Place it in the oven, cook in the oven at 200 degrees C for 15 minutes.



Serve with Pasta or Rice and Bon Appetit !
